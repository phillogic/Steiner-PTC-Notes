    <td>Prior to this stage, starting formal education too early might disrupt the natural maturation of the etheric body, potentially impacting both the child’s health and their ability to fully integrate their physical and cognitive capacities.</td>
    <td>By the time a child enters primary school, they have undergone significant development. The etheric body is now ready to support learning and memory.
The 7-year-old child is strongly interested in learning and remains immersed in a sense of wonder about the world. However, unlike the first seven years where learning occurs through imitation, the primary school years focus on language, stories, and the use of imagination through words.
Children at this stage look to adults for stories and kind words of recognition. Teachers should be authentic in their communication, using specific and meaningful praise rather than generic compliments.
Between ages 7 and 9, children's memory develops to a more continuous form. Rhythmic memory, supported through activities like learning long poems, plays a crucial role in this development.
Rhythmic exercises also support the etheric body, helping to anchor the learning process.
