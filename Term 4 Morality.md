# Practical approaches to moral education & spiritual development with  James Deefholts - Oct 23, 2024

# Morality

Cannot be taught with words.
Cannot teach empathy through intellectual means.. it is taught through soul life
If u try to talk a cchild into morality u would end up creating an antipathy for it.

Especially in teen-ages when teachesrs talk at children about right or wrong things, children jsut shutdown. The best way is to model that and give the children an experience of it.

some of the virtues in stiener are truth, beauty and goodness.
In the first 7 years we surround the children with goodness... our stories are filled with human beings are kind and caring with each other. You dont bring up current affairs etc.. because thru this sense of wholness and goodness children live with a sense of optimizm and the world is a goo dplace.

7 -14 : we work with beauty.Beauty as in the inner movement when we experience something that is beautiful. So instead of good and bad u ask the children what is more beautiful to help their inner development

14-21 : we work with truth. We are bringing them things that are spiritually true... so instead of just giving arbitrary rules without explaining the value of them the children will consider it false. This sense of children seeking for truth in what u are saying prolly starts around 9. 

# Spirituality

*Spirtuality* is not something we teach.. life experiences and how children meet those experiecnes will cultivate an inner spirtual life

# Where are we as humanity
Intelelctual soul age we have moved from to conciousness soul age as per Steiner.
The intelelctual soul age is when humanity operated much more from their intellect.
The greek-roman empires etc began at the intellecual soul stage where reason etc were at the core of creating the structures we live with

Concious Soul.. operates out of intuition, imagination with the soul.
We are rasiing young people who are working much more at that level then even us as teacheers and parents.
The conciousness soul age plays out in scoiety..the instituations in intellectual soul age are not quite serviing the greater good of soceity.
So what is being asked of us it to forgo our conditioning to meet the needs of the people coming to our us.

We are also moving away from the collective clan or tribe but to the development of the individual. This potential of indivudalization allows us to understand what gifts are unique to each of us that if nurtured can serve the world better.

This indivudlization makes it hard to understnand the other and our selves through each other.
In ancient egypt people would walk past and see each other meet the other person in their soul... and then move on.

Given this how do we work with children.

In education its useful to strive to get the indivudality of the child i.e u tease apart from race, nationalitym, social circle, the true individual and the gifts they carry.. so we can work with those gifts.

So how do u celeberate these gifts.. 

1) through culture of the class room. e.g On birthday create a card for a student, draw a pic on the card for example what flower encapsulates the child. also a student of the week, draw student's face on the baord.. and every child would draw a pic of this student and write some information about that person.
stories of saints,, stories of indivudals finding their individual calling and bringing it to others.

2) We want to bring depth to children and understandinf of what really is human, i.e the inner qualities.
3) Help young people understand their capaicty and others capacituy but also how do u meet the other or work with the other for e.g use restorative circles.. and even talk with somebody did this or that rather than use names.
4) An important part of steiner is theraputic/healing stories.. which capture what happend in an interaction
5) look at dead ant game as a cooperative game
6) 


# 7 - 14 feeling life
we see in children the development of their inner life.
along that time is when we have opportunity to work on the moral education of the child.

## 9 year old change
Strong change , an awakening to existential human experiences like loneliness occurs . As these painful experiences happen we just need to hold these types of experiecnes with them rather than take them away.

A child may not say they are lonely... and they might not be able to articulate it..instead of digging into it we just comfort them like a foot bath etc.
A lot of children will talk about that I dont have friends...and this is quite universal and its not personal so we can also deal with it as something universal.
If we can sit in loneliness this can really help spiritual growth.

## 10 year old
normally feel rejection on top of loneliness.

## 12
At 12 children can perceive the impact of their actions.. prior to 12 if we try to get a child to see how their action affected someone.. we either create blame or shame. Or they learn to respond in a way to get your approval but have no processing of the causal chain
