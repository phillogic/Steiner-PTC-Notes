A:
Winter it comes
with chilly nights
rosy cheeks, gloved hands
frosty morning, crunchy snow
Hot co-co, marshmaellows
warm glow, shimmering snow
misty mountains  towering tall
Winter it comes after fall

B:
Bears are asleep
The snakes go deep
The rabboits keep playing
The foxes keep chasing
Pomegrantes so sweet
and oranges also tangy
the kiwis are juicy
and strawberries very berry
