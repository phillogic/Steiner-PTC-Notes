# Submission in support of Year 2

The year I have chosen to focus on is Year 2, a pivotal stage as children step into their eighth year of life. This year is significant because it serves as a foundation for the child's continued development, preparing them for the transformative challenges of the 9-year-old crisis. 

# Main Lesson Story "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"

 The Boy Who Cried Wolf[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Fables_of_%C3%86sop_(Jacobs)/The_Shepherd%27s_Boy] 


### Learning Areas for Class 2

1. **Moral Development through Storytelling and Role-Play**  
   - Explore contrasts like *attention vs. honesty vs. deception* to foster ethical and empathetical awareness.

2. **Fine Motor Skills and Imagination**  
   - Strengthen coordination and creativity through **drawing, crafts, and artistic activities**.

3. **Numeracy Practice**  
   - Focus on **skip counting**, patterns, and rhythmic integration with movement and recitation.

4. **Rhythmic Memory and Musical Skills**  
   - Develop **rhythmic memory** and **muscle coordination** through singing and recorder practice.



## Morning Circle Activities
- Morning verse :
  <br>
  "I lift my arms to the clear blue sky,<br>
  I stretch them high and I stretch them wide. <br>
  Firmly on the earth I stand,To my neighbour I give my hand.<br>
  A friend to the left,<br>
  A friend to the right,<br>
  Angels keep me well in sight."-   [LHZ,rythms](#lou-harvey-rhythm-document)



## Movement Game & Numeracy: 
 - *Shepherd herding* - The shepherd gently "herds" the sheep in a zig zag pattern around the trees while skip counting aloud. Sheep follow in rhythm, hopping to the count. When we reach the 20th key number the shepered becomes a sheep and the sheep behding the shepered becomes the shepherd.
 
- *Beanbag Star Patterns*:
  Children sit or stand in a circle. Skip counting begins (e.g., 2s, 3s, or 5s), and a beanbag is passed to every second or third child, creating a star-like pattern across the circle. - based on  [LHZ, movement games 2024](#lou-harvey-movement-games)

- *Sheep Counting*
  1. **Shepherd Counting**:
    The shepherd calls out: “Sheep, sheep, into your groups! Count in 2s!” (or 3s, 5s etc.).
    The "sheep" form groups based on the given number and sit or stand together in their groups (e.g., groups of 2s, 3s, or 5s).
    The shepherd walks calmly around the groups, counting aloud to tally the total number of sheep.
    Example: “2, 4, 6… I see 6 sheep!”
  2. **Lost Sheep and Reorganization**:
   The shepherd then falls asleep i.e cannot hear or see. The teacher randomly asks a random number of sheep to rest behind the shepard so he cannot see them.
    When the sheperd wakes up he excalims  “Oh no! Some sheep wandered off to the hills!”
    The remaining sheep reorganize into new groups the best they can (e.g., this time count by 3s or 5s).
    The shepherd counts the new groups to find out how many sheep are left and how many wandered off?


## End of Lesson Verse

"Our lessons now have ended, <br>
What we have learnt will rest,<br>
When we have done our very best,<br>
Wisdom, love and power will grow <br>
And we shall bless all those we know" -  [LHZ,rythms](#lou-harvey-rhythm-document)

## Black board drawing
I would draw and color a blackboard drawing of a shepherd boy, sheep at the bottom of a mountainm near a dark forest.

## Recorder Pieces

For keeping our connection with nature as well aligning towrds our main lesson of the boy who cried wolf I would use the following recorder peices:
 - "In the Heart of a Seed" - [AA, 2024 ,Music Course Booklet](#adrienne-music-2024)
 - "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" -  [AA, 2024,Music Course Booklet](#adrienne-music-2024)

## Painting & Crafts

- Watercolor Painting: A calm pond with a sheperd and sheep.

- Beeswax Modeling: Create figures of the boy, sheep, and the wolf.
  
- Wool Felting: Create  felted sheep using wool to connect with the story's theme.

## Form Drawing
 - Nature forms: Drawing hills/trees using curved lines e.g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyNYl4xWItk
 - Celtic Knots: Drawing simple interwoven Celtic knot like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBHGNjv44Ig for practicing symmtery.


## Drama/Role Play

- We would act out  fable in groups with the children: the boy, villagers, and the wolf.
- Help the children emphasize the changing tone when trust is broken to give a dramatic flair.

## Reflection and Discussion

1. **Discuss the moral of the story**  
   - What was the need behind the villagers coming the first 2 times?
   - What stopped them from coming the third time?
   - What need was behind the shepard boy's acting the way he did?
   - How do we all feel when our need for honesty and trust is not met?
   - How do we feel when we act in ways that do not meet our own need for honesty and being trustworthy towards others?

## Incursion/Excursion Ideas

- Koala Park Sydney Visit: Observe sheep and discuss their care in the farmyard facility of the park.
- Invite Diane Tatum for an awesome story telling rendition of the boy who cried wolf.
- Invite Adrienne Alexander to sing her amazing song "The Boy who crief Wolf .




## Navigating Year 2 Challenges

The principal approach in Year 2 would be to continue to focuses on solidifying what was started in Year 1. This would be via essential rhythms, strengthening focus skills, and deepening moral understanding; however, the following challenges may require specific attention.



### Difficulty  with focused learning 

While the etheric body is more available for focused learning, some children may still struggle with formal tasks.

A way to manage this might be to tap into the child's more readily available rhythmic memory which can be stimulated via rhythmic exercises (singing, dancing) to promote learning.


### Deepening moral development without judgements

The children may be grappling with things like fairness/consequences/goodness/darkness. Using stories about [Saint Francis of Assisi]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi)   like the [wolf of Gubbio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_of_Gubbio) to bring gentleness compaission to discourses on moral dilemmas. 


### Dealing with conflict

The year 2 child may now become more aware of conflicts within their cohort. This might create tension in the classroom. I can attempt to address this  by facilitating group work through arts/crafts, stories and games to nurture a sense of empathy and compassion for all.
